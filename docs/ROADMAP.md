# Suni Development Roadmap

## 🎯 Project Vision
A personal side project to build a complete e-commerce platform demonstrating modern web development skills. Focus on core e-commerce functionality: product management, shopping cart, checkout flow (guest & member), and admin management system.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Performance Strategy

### Caching Strategy
- **Redis/Memcached**: Hot data caching (product listings, categories, user sessions)
- **API Response Caching**: Frequently accessed endpoints with TTL
- **Database Query Caching**: Expensive queries and aggregations
- **Static Asset Caching**: Images, CSS, JS with CDN integration

### CDN & Global Delivery
- **Cloudflare/AWS CloudFront**: Static asset delivery and edge caching
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic compression and format conversion
- **Global Edge Locations**: Reduced latency for international users
- **DDoS Protection**: Built-in security and traffic management

### Deployment Architecture
- **Load Balancing**: Multiple server instances for high availability
- **Database Replication**: Read replicas for improved performance
- **Auto Scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on traffic
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance and error tracking
